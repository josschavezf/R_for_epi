# Let's recap

- Vectors
- One dimension
- All vector components must be the same type
- R finds a way to unify data type
- Define a vector with c()
- Access vector elements using integer index, name or logical evaluation

# Vectors (Part II)

---
## How to modify a vector?

- Adding a new element

```{r}
x <- c("a","b","c")
x

x[4] <- "d"
x
```

---

- Removing an element

```{r}
x
x[-2]
x <- x[-2]
x
```

---
## Excercise

Using the vector:
```{r}
fruits <- c("apples" = 1, 
            "cherries" = 10,
            "mangos" = 7) 
```

- Add a new fruit to the vector
- Remove the cherries

---

- Replacing an element by index

```{r}
x
x[1] <- "m"
x
```

---
- Replacing an element by logical evaluation

```{r}
x
x[x == "d"] <- "e"
x
```

---

## Excercise

Using the vector:
```{r}
fruits <- c("apples" = 1, 
            "cherries" = 10,
            "mangos" = 7) 
```

- Select all fruits with values bigger than 5
- Replace the apples number with 4

# Matrices

---

# Creating a matrix

Matrices are objects with elements arranged in a two-dimensional layout.

```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(data = 1:12, nrow = 4)
my_matrix
```

- rows and columns
- All elements must be the same type

---
class: chapter-slide

# Operations with matrices

---

# Arithmetic operations

```{r}
my_matrix + 10
my_matrix * 2
```

---

# Operations with matrices

```{r}
matrix1 <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
matrix2 <- matrix(7:12, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
matrix1
matrix2
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
matrix1 + matrix2
```
]

# Data Frames

---

# What is a data frame?

- Two-dimensional arranged data (tables)
- rows and columns
- All columns must be the same length
- Columns can have different type of data
- All components in the column must be the same type (vector)

---
# Creating a data frame

```{r}
fruits <- data.frame(
  name = c("apples","berries","mangos","bananas"),  
  number = c(1, 10, 7, 2),
  edible_shell = c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE) )
fruits
```

---

# Properties of data frames

- nrow

```{r}
nrow(fruits)
```

- ncol

```{r}
ncol(fruits)
```
---

- dim

```{r}
dim(fruits)
```

---

- rownames

```{r}
rownames(fruits)
```

- colnames

```{r}
colnames(fruits)
```

---
# Practice excercise

Create a data frame (patients) that contains the following information:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
patients <- data.frame(first_name = c("Ava","Noah","Olivia"), 
                       last_name =  c("Smith", "Johnson", "Williams" ),
                       age = c(65, 20, 47),
                       co_morbidity = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
)
patients
```

- How many rows and columns does the data frame have?
- Print the columns names

---
class: chapter-slide

# How to access data frame elements?

---

# Using row and column index

Syntaxis: df[row,column]

```{r}
fruits
fruits[2,3]
```

---

Select rows 1 to 2 from column 3

```{r}
fruits[1:2,3]
```

---
# Your turn!

Using the patients data frame 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
patients <- data.frame(first_name = c("Ava","Noah","Olivia"), 
                       last_name =  c("Smith", "Johnson", "Williams" ),
                       age = c(65, 20, 47),
                       co_morbidity = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
)
patients
```

- Extract the last name and age from Ava and Noah 

---

Select all rows from column 2

```{r}
my_matrix[,2]
```

Select all columns from row 2

```{r}
my_matrix[2,]
```

---
# Your turn!

Using the patients data frame 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
patients <- data.frame(first_name = c("Ava","Noah","Olivia"), 
                       last_name =  c("Smith", "Johnson", "Williams" ),
                       age = c(65, 20, 47),
                       co_morbidity = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
)
patients
```

- Extract all the information (columns) from Olivia.
- Extract the age from all patients

# Lists

---

# What is a list?

- A collection of like or unlike objects
- Each object can have different dimensions
---

```{r}
list(a_number = 15,
     fruits = data.frame(name = c("apples",
                                  "mangos"),
                         number = c(3,10)),
     my_matrix = matrix(1:6, nrow = 2)
)
```
