# Let's recap

- **tibbles**
- **Import** and **export** tibbles
- **filter** data by row
- **select** columns (variables)
- **pivot longer** (columns to rows)
- **pivot wider** (rows to columns)

# summarise()

---
## Calculate the average age of sinai covid patients

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load libraries
library(tidyverse) 
library(janitor)

# Import data
sinai_covid <- read_csv("sinai_covid.csv")

# clean names
sinai_covid <- sinai_covid %>% 
  clean_names()
```
---

```{r}
# summarise data
sinai_covid %>% 
  summarise(mean(age))
```

--

Even better, assign a name to the result
```{r}
sinai_covid %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age))
```

---
Calculate more than one summarise
```{r}
sinai_covid %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age),
            sd_age = sd(age))
```


---
# Your turn!

- Use summarise to calculate the median, max and min values of age

---
# How does summarise works?

.center[Split-Apply-Combine]

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/split.png")
```

---
# group_by() 

Get the mean age and sd of sinai covid patients by sex
```{r}
sinai_covid %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age),
            sd_age = sd(age))
```

---
# Your turn!

- Calculate the median age, and average bmi of sinai covid patients by facility

---
We can use multiple variables to group by

```{r}
sinai_covid %>% 
  group_by(facility, sex) %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age),
            sd_age = sd(age)) %>% 
  head(4)
```

---
# Let's practice!

- Find the mean, median and sd of the systolic_bp by smoking status and sex

---
# count()

For qualitative variables

```{r}
sinai_covid %>% 
  count(smoking_status)
```

---
# Excercise

- How many patients have chronic kidney disease?

---
- group and count

```{r}
sinai_covid %>% 
  group_by(facility) %>% 
  count(smoking_status, diabetes)
```

---

```{r}
sinai_covid %>% 
  group_by(facility) %>% 
  filter(diabetes == 1) %>% 
  count(smoking_status,diabetes)
```

---

# join()

---
- Create tibble 1

```{r}
tibble1 <- sinai_covid %>%
  filter(smoking_status %in% c("YES", "NEVER")) %>% 
  count(smoking_status, name = "total")

tibble1
```

---
- Create tibble 2

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tibble2 <- sinai_covid %>% 
  filter(smoking_status %in% c("YES", "QUIT")) %>% 
  group_by(smoking_status) %>% 
  summarise(n_diabetes = sum(diabetes),
            n_obesity = sum(obesity))

tibble2
```

---
- Join tibbles

- Keep rows from left tibble
```{r}
left_join(tibble1, tibble2)
```

---
- Keep rows from right tibble

```{r}
right_join(tibble1, tibble2)
```

---
- Keep rows in common

```{r}
inner_join(tibble1, tibble2)
```

---
- Keep all rows

```{r}
full_join(tibble1, tibble2)
```

---
# Let's practice

- Count the number of patients by ethnicity, store the result in tibble 1
- Calculate the mean systolic_bp and mean diastolic_bp by ethnicity, store the result in tibble 2
- Join the tibbles
