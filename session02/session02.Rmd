# Data structures in R

# Vectors

---

# Creating a vector

## Using the assignment operator

For one value

```{r}
my_vector <- 10
my_vector <- "a"
```

---
## Using the combine function

For two or more values

```{r}
my_vector <- c(1,10,25,30)
my_vector

my_vector <- c("a","b","c")
my_vector
```

---
## Using the seq() function

```{r}
my_vector <- seq(1:10)
my_vector

my_vector <- seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)
my_vector
```

---
# Vector features

- Vectors have only one dimension (length)

```{r}
my_vector <- c(1,2,3,4)
length(my_vector)
```

---
- All vector components must be the same type

    - Numeric
    - Integer
    - Double
    - Character
    - Factor
    - Logical

---

- Numeric
```{r}
x_num <- c(1, 2, 3)
class(x_num)
```
--

- Integer
```{r}
x_int <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
class(x_int)
```
---

- Double
```{r}
x_dbl <- c(1, 2.5, 3.1)
typeof(x_dbl)
```
--

- Character

```{r}
x_chr <- c("a", "b", "c")
class(x_chr)
```
---

- Factor
```{r}
x_fct <- factor("a","b","c")
class(x_fct)
```
--

- Logical
```{r}
x_log <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
class(x_log)
```

---

- R finds a way to unify data type when there is more than one per vector

```{r}
x <- c(1, "a", TRUE)
x
class(x)
```

---
# Missing values

- NA

```{r}
x <- c(1, "a", TRUE, NA)
x
```

- NaN

```{r,warning=FALSE}
x <- c(10, -1, NA)
log(x)
```

# How to access vector elements?

---
## Using integer as index

Vector index in R starts from 1

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
x

x[3] # Extract the third element
```

---
```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

# Extract index from 3 to 5
x[3:5]
```

--
```{r}
x <- c("a","b","c","d","e")

# Extract index 2 and 5
x[c(2,5)] 
```
---

## Using the name as index

```{r}
x <- c(1,3,10)
names(x)
```
--

```{r}
x <- c("first"= 1,"second"=3,"third"=10)
x
names(x)
```

---

```{r}
x <- c(1,3,10)

names(x) <- c("first", "second", "third")
x
```

--
```{r}
x["second"]
x[c("first","third")]
```

---

## Using logical evaluation as index

```{r}

x <- seq(1:10)
x

x < 5

x[x < 5]
```

---

```{r}

x <- c("a","a","b","c","c","c")

x == "c"

x[x == "c"]
```

---

## Excercise

Using the vector:
```{r}
fruits <- c("apples" = 1, 
            "cherries" = 10,
            "mangos" = 3) 
```

Extract the number of cherries using 1) the integer index, 2) the name, and 3) a logical evaluation

# How to modify a vector?

---

- Adding a new element

```{r}
x <- c("a","b","c")
x

x[4] <- "d"
x
```

---

- Removing an element

```{r}
x
x[-2]
x <- x[-2]
x
```

---

- Replacing an element

```{r}
x
x[x == "d"] <- "e"
x
x[1] <- "m"
x
```

---

- Selecting and replacing elements using negative conditional

```{r}
x <- c("a","a","b","c","c","c")
x[x != "c"] 
x[x != "c"] <- "e"
x
```

---

## Excercise

Using the vector:
```{r}
fruits <- c("apples" = 1, 
            "cherries" = 10,
            "mangos" = 7) 
```

- Add a new fruit to the vector
- Select all fruits with values bigger than 5
- Replace the apples number

# Operations with vectors

---
# Arithmetic operations

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
x + 1
x*3
log10(x)
```

---
# Operations between vectors

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
y <- c(6,7,8,9,10)
x + y
```

--

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
y <- c(1,2)
x + y
```

# Matrices

---

# Creating a matrix

Matrices are objects with elements arranged in a two-dimensional layout.

```{r}
matrix(data = 1:12, nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
```

By deafult, elements are arranged by column

---

Arranging the matrix by row

```{r}
matrix(data = 1:12, 
       nrow = 4, ncol = 3, 
       byrow = TRUE)
```

---

# Properties of matrices

- nrow

```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(data = 1:12, 
                    nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
nrow(my_matrix)
```

- ncol

```{r}
ncol(my_matrix)
```

---

- dim

```{r}
dim(my_matrix)
```

- rownames

```{r}
rownames(my_matrix)
```

- colnames

```{r}
colnames(my_matrix)
```

---

Assigning rownames and colnames

```{r}
rownames(my_matrix) <- c("A","B","C","D")
colnames(my_matrix) <- c("a","b","c")

my_matrix
```

# Using row and column index

Syntaxis: matrix[row,column]

```{r}
my_matrix
my_matrix[2,3]
```

---

Select rows 1 to 2 from column 3

```{r}
my_matrix[1:2,3]
```

Select rows 1 to 2 from columns 2 to 3

```{r}
my_matrix[1:2,2:3]
```

---

Select all rows from column 2

```{r}
my_matrix[,2]
```

Select all columns from row 2

```{r}
my_matrix[2,]
```
